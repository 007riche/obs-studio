Compilation instructions!  Temporary quick compilation instructions!
Will give better instructions later when things are in a more complete state.

Windows:
  - Use VS2013, as obs-studio uses C99 and C++11

  - Download latest FFmpeg repositories and Qt5 release

  - Create a windows environment variable FFmpegPath.  Set it to your FFmpeg
    repo path

  - Create a windows environment variable QTDIR.  Set it to your
    Qt5 install path

  - Compile FFmpeg and Qt5(Until they release a binary VS2013 version).
    They should both be compiled with VS2013.
    For compiling FFmpeg, see http://ffmpeg.org/platform.html#Windows

  - Create two directories in FFmpeg directory, lib32 and lib64.  Place the
    lib files generated by FFmpeg into these directories for the respective
    architecture

  - If compiling FFmpeg with shared libraries (DLLs), place the DLLs into
    build/bin/32bit and/or build/bin/64bit respectively

  - Compile project with VS2013, and it should be good to go.

  - NOTE: Direct3D 11 library may require D3Dcompiler_47.dll to be present
    in both the obs-studio/build/bin/32bit and obs-studio/build/bin/64bit
    directories


Mac OSX
  - Use macports or homebrew and get FFmpeg, glew and cmake.

  - In a terminal, go to the obs-studio directory create a cmbuild subdir
    and change to it, then to build, type: cmake .. && make

  - It builds in a modular structure similar to windows, where everything
    necessary to run the program is compiled to cmbuild/rundir

  - You can also use ccmake to create an app bundle, which makes it so you
    don't have to use the terminal to execute it from the correct directory


Linux
  - You need a fairly recent Linux distribution.
    Ubuntu 14.04 or a similar recent Linux distribution works fine, but
    anything that's up-to-date should work.
    Ubuntu 13.10 or older will _not_ work because of the ancient
    version of libav they use.

  - Because Ubuntu and Debian come with libav instead of ffmpeg, you have
    to get the original ffmpeg. Recommended:
    For Ubuntu 14.04:
      https://launchpad.net/~jon-severinsson/+archive/ubuntu/ffmpeg
    For Debian:
      http://www.deb-multimedia.org/

  - There is also a ppa available in case you do not want to compile
    yourself(Ubuntu 14.04 only):
      https://launchpad.net/~btbn/+archive/ubuntu/obs-studio

  - Build dependencies on Ubuntu 14.04 with ppa from above:
    cmake libpulse-dev qtbase5-dev libqt5x11extras5-dev libavcodec-dev
    libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libx264-dev libswresample-dev
    libfdk-aac-dev libxinerama-dev libxcomposite-dev libxrandr-dev

  - Building in portable mode(assuming you are in a terminal in the
    obs-studio base dir):
    
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DUNIX_STRUCTURE=0 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="${HOME}/obs-studio-portable" ..
    make -j4 && make install

  - After that you should have a portable install in ~/obs-studio-portable
    Change to bin/64bit or bin/32bit and run ./obs to run it.

  - If you want to install obs-studio into your system, it's recommended
    to use checkinstall instead of a plain make install. It allows for a
    clean uninstall and allows the package manager to keep track of the
    installed files:

    sudo apt-get install checkinstall
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DUNIX_STRUCTURE=1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
    make -j4
    sudo checkinstall
